BUILD_BRCM_BASE_SHELL
BUILD_BRCM_CMS
BUILD_BRCM_BDK
   BASE_SHELL: No Broadcom configuration management system.  This option is
   for internal engineering use or customers who want to use their own
   configuration management system.  This option will only build the minimal
   userspace software, such as Busybox and various Broadcom control utilities.
   Additional software items, such as Wifi, can be enabled as long as they do
   not depend on CMS.

   CMS: The standard Configuration Management System that has been used
   in Broadcom SDK's since 4.02L.01.

   BDK: A new Advanced Gateway Platform which was introduced starting
   in 5.04L.01.  When you choose this option, many sub-options

   selected objects from TR181: IPV6, Optical, and SoftwareModules.
   These TR181 features must still be enabled in their sections.  Root of
   Data Model is InternetGatewayDevice.

   Pure181: Use TR181 (do not use TR98).  Root of Data Model is Device.

   DM_Detect: compile both TR98 and TR181 objects.  Early in system bootup,
   use some external method to determine which data model the CPE should use,
   and use that data model.  Note that although both data models are compiled,
   only one of them is usable and active at runtime.

    as this is considered a successful boot. Otherwise, if system becomes unresponsive during the Watchdog tracking
    CFEROM on SoftReset determines the reason of the crash then switches to previously installed or fallback image.
    If fallback image is also crashed - CFEROM halts the system.
    Default Watchdog delays are - CFEROM CFERAM both are given 30s for Watchdog timer to exppire. Linux given 60s.

    Try to use as much from Openwrt as possible (e.g. hostapd, iw).  This config
    is commonly used for Retail routers.

    In Carrier mode (the default), use some BDK components (e.g. sys_directory, tr69c, DSL, GPON).
    Uses Broadcom and BDK Wifi tools instead of native Openwrt wifi tools.

ENABLE_APP_COREDUMPS
  Save new coredump files to /data/core.new/core_appname and move previous coredumps to /data/core.last on every reboot.
  /data is limited flash storage. Please be careful about this.
  See targets/fs.src/etc/init.d/system-config.sh and targets/buildFS for details.
END

BRCM_CHECK_PKGTB_SIG
  If enabled, the Linux image update functions will require the
  pkgtb binary package headers to be signed with an RSA signature
  or else they will be rejected.
  See targets/keys/demo/PKG/ for examples
END

PKGTB_KEY_DIR
  The directory in which the authorized_pkg_keys directory exists
  and contains one or more .pem files with the public keys for
  pkgtb header validation

  The private key signing will be controlled by options file variables
  such as

  bcm_uboot_pkgtb_sign = targets/keys/demo/PKG/pkg_private.pem
  bcm_uboot_pkgtb_signer = sign_openssl_simple.sh

END

BUILD_VANILLA_BUSYBOX

    e.g. userspace/gpl/apps/busybox/vanilla_busybox-$version/
END

BUILD_VANILLA_BUSYBOX_LITE
    If enabled, build the ultra lite version of vanilla busybox.
    It is mainly for Broadcom internal development.
END

BUILD_BCMBUSYBOX
    If enabled, build the broadcom busybox which is with Broadcom customization.
    e.g. userspace/gpl/apps/busybox/bcm_busybox-$version/
END

BUILD_BCMBUSYBOX_NTPD
    If enabled, build the Broadcom customized ntpd applets with broadcom busybox.
    It is used to sync the internet time.
END

BUILD_DTC

END

BUILD_WEBUI_LICENSE_UPLOAD
    If enabled, [Advanced Setup | Licenses] WEB page is displayed to upload licenses.
END

BUILD_BCM_WLMLO
    If enabled, Build WLAN MLO firmwares

BUILD_BCM_WLAUX
    If enabled, Build WLAN AUX core module

BRCM_VOICE_DSP_PROFILER
    (Broadcom internal use only) If enabled, build LDX profiler DPR
    module and related endpoint module, This feature also depends on Linux
    kernel Perf feature as well
END

BRCM_VOICE_DSP_16FXS
    If enabled, build LDX 16 FXS port image
END

BUILD_EMMC_REPART
    If enabled, build the eMMC field BOOTFS resizing script. This script will increase
    the bootfs to a size indicated by BRCM_REPART_MIN_BOOTFS_SIZE. The BOOTFS size
    increment will be done at the expense of ROOTFS size i.e ROOTFS size will be reduced.
END

BUILD_OPENTHREAD
    OpenThread implements the Thread networking protocol and is used by some
    Enterprise WLAN SOCs as part of their Bluetooth interface (4711).
END

BCM_TINY_COREDUMP
    If enabled, the tiny kernel coredump feature is build into the linux kernel. Drivers can add
    objects of interest through API functions. User-space can obtain the dump from /proc/tinykcore
    and upon a kernel panic the dump is written onto a MTD partition if specified with the module
    parameter "mtddev". For example, in uboot, you can set:
    setenv bootargs_append "tkcore.mtddev=3"
    saveenv
    With the above a kernel panic will write the coredump to /dev/mtd3 and after reboot it can be
    obtained using:
    # dd bs=4096 count=1215 if=/dev/mtd3 | epi_ttcp -t <server_ipaddr>
